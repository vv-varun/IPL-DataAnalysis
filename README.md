# IPL-DataAnalysis
In this project, I am analyzing the IPL data with the following goal:
- Derive some interesting and meaningful insights
- Do some real life predictions

## Data Source
The data has been taken from multiple sources and merged into a single data source.

- Data Set 1: From [Data world](https://data.world/raghu543/ipl-data-till-2017)

    This data source contains ball-by-ball details of matches from 2008-2017. 

- Data Set 2: From [Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org) -- Yet to be imported and merged.

In order to derive best statistics, I have used the most granular data. 
The data set is huge, and is not suitable for direct analysis.

So, I have pre-processed it and exported only the data required for my analysis as CSV files.


## Problems to Analyze
Several kinds of analysis can be done from this data. In my project, I'll focus on the following.
1. Predict the match result at the start of the final over
